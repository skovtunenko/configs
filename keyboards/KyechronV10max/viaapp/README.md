# Keychron V10 Max

config only for https://usevia.app/

NOTE: as of 7.DEC.2024 I updated the firmware to 1.0.0 and the keyboard is not working with VIA,
the layout is not being recognized. Don't know why, so I switched to https://launcher.keychron.com/ for configuration
and re-do the config from scratch.
